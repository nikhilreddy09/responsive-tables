        <dt>1.The Secret Life Of Pets 2</dt>
        <dd>Good movie. Not amazing, but worth seeing. The story felt a little rushed, and scattered at times. The voice acting was great. It was funny enough for me to have some good laughs. Overall, a good movie for children and enjoyable for all ages.</dd>
        
        <dt>2.John Wick: Chapter 3 </dt>
        <dd>Nobody does killing better than John Wick so if you love watching action films, this one is a must-watch. For those who already know about John Wick’s abilities, you’ll be even more impressed with what is accomplished here. John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum is an ultraviolent extravaganza that’s one of the most fun films of the year.</dd>
            
        
        <dt>3.Pokemon Detective Pikachu</dt>
        <dd>While the plot may not be the thickest, this movie Mark's the most important video game to film adaptation in history. True to the source material, true to the core audience.. this movie could have gone monstrously wrong but they show clear evidence that this movie was a labor of love to and from fans alike, rather than a quick cash grab as it could have easily been </dd>
            
        <dt>4.Shazam!</dt>
            <dd>DC is finally building a solid run: Shazam is a delight! Its familiar origin structure is forgivable because of all the new it brings to the table - primarily it's gleeful, childlike enthusiasm, & heartfelt perspective on family. It's also the role Zachary Levi was born to play.</dd>
